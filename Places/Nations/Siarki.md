The society of Siarki consists of its eponymous capital and two nearby cities: [[{NORTH_SIARKI}]] and [[Ikishi]]. Siarki is a strong ally of [[Arbor]] and [[Dhonharo]]. Yet, the Siar government greatly resents Arbor’s other close ally, [[Destora]].

Siarki is known in part for the [[Light Wall]]: a large concrete wall with stripes of illuminated glass encompassing the northern, southern, and eastern parts of the city. It is also known for [[University Siarki]]. The nation also owns [[New Hope Island]] in conjunction with Arbor.
## History
### Guilds
Centuries after the [[War on Virtue]], the [[Northern Forest Alliance]] was in a state of statis. It gave little incentive for change. As a result, critters began leaving the territory southward. Some settled west of the [[Arboreal River]], near the [[Teumessian Sea]]. These expats, consisting primarily of naturalists, professors, authors, and scientists, founded six guilds by the mouth of modern-day [[River Siar]]. The three guilds to the north focused on art, design, and engineering, while the three guilds to the south focused on various fields of science.

The northern and southern trios held a rivalry to inspire competition. Ultimately, however, they heavily supported each other, sharing resources and discoveries.

The [[Great Western Drought]] threatened the guilds, bringing them close to disbanding. They as a result opened trade with the newly founded [[Doveport]], which was largely unaffected by the drought. Although most trade for resources ended soon after the end of the drought, Siarki and Doveport continued to exchange publications.
### City-State
Siarki sought to become more self-sufficient and expanded outward, opening mines and building larger farms. Inspired by Doveport's recent invention of the moveable type press, Siarki constructs a capitol building and writes the [[Article Siar]], officially becoming a city-state. They also begin construction on the [[University Siarki]], completing it about 5 calendars later.

As an effort to standardize trade, and to solidify their place in the valley, Siarki later built [[Center Skil]]: the region's first mint and bank. They produced currency initially to facilitate external trade, not for private use. However, Doveport adopted it as a true currency for internal trade as well, eventually opening the [[Bank of Doveport]].

One of Siarki's earliest large contributions to the region was the invention of the train. Siarki and Doveport began to lay rails northward toward the [[Northern Forest Alliance]]. The N.F.A., disinterested in the two city-states, would not aid in this construction for over a century.
#### Dhonharo
As Siarki rapidly grew, it lost critters to emigration. Its governing style was (and still is) heavy-handed. Constitutionally, unrehabilitatable citizens must be exiled. These critters left for the southern city of [[Sidhil]]. At first, Siarki wasn't concerned with this. But after the city became the nation of [[Dhonharo]], they started communicating. The fledgling nation, though industrious, was in need of resources and land, which Siarki gladly traded in exchange for the cheap labor provided by the [Ridhil](Ridhil%20Culture.md)-influenced critters.

### Nation
Although it was considered a nation as far back as the [[Teumessian Conflict]], Siarki officially became a nation with the founding of [[{NORTH_SIARKI}]]. This city emerged from a need to move heavy industry outside of the rapidly expanding capital.

Today, most critters in the nation of Siarki, especially within the capital city, are of [[Ruti culture]] and worship [[Kashada]]: a prophetic robot built long ago, which resembles a critter.
## Politics
The capital city is a communist city; the government owns everything inside the city’s walls and provides for all residents.

The nation of Siarki as a whole, including parts of the city outside of the Light Wall, is highly socialist; its government provides all necessities for its citizens, who in turn distribute it. Local Managers perform surveys and censuses of their regions and enforce legislation. The technocratic Primary Administration consists of governors who are experts in their particular fields of governing; for example, the Transportation Administer is necessarily a critter with experience in transportation: an urban designer, a conductor, etc. The Upper Administration oversees the Primary Administration and intervenes when necessary; the public is usually not even aware of this administration. Finally, the Tertiary Administration, often based in [[Ikishi]], consists of to-be governors ready to take the place of a Primary Administrator; they are practically trainees to their counterparts in the Primary Administration.

The government is constitutional; they follow the [[Article Siar]]. This constitutional is mutable, however; the government has historically appended or removed parts in order to allow the nation to continue to grow and prosper.

Siarki lacks political democracy; citizens have no opportunities to vote on governors or legislation. Instead, they can influence their Local Managers through censuses and polls. The government is immensely bureaucratic, so they send many of these censuses.

Citizens are expected to meet a quota to keep their benefits and citizenship. This quota may be based on time, produced units, or completed projects, depending on the specific job. A citizen's occupation is assigned to them depending on their individual skills and education as well as the needs of the nation. Citizens can petition to change their occupation.
## Economy
Although it runs banks for other Arboreal nations and directly controls the [[skil]], Siarki does not use currency for internal trade; rather, it provides allowances for its citizens to spend on any luxuries that the government deems unessential. (Both inside and outside the capital city, the government ensures that citizens receive all essential goods and services.)

Despite its socialist government, the nation of Siarki has the second-highest GDP in the [[Arboreal River Valley]]. They are significant contributors to the industries of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, motor engines, and banking. They also receive a high revenue from patents and education, thanks to the cultural value in inventiveness and the presence of the [[University Siarki]]. Ikishi and the southern part of the city of Siarki both receive a considerable amount of revenue from tourism and religious pilgrimage.
