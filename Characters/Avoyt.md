**Avoyt** ([[Yarla]]: **Yashot**) is an adult [[critter]] who serves as the ambassador for the [Siar](Siarki.md) government. He is one of the four [aetherwolves](Aetherwolf.md).

He makes frequent appearances in political newsnband occasionalb public speeches on behalf of Siarki. Being essentially Siarki's mouthpiece, Avoyt often takes the heat for rumors and questionable actions that relate to Siarki.

He is happily married to [[Naomi]]. He occasionally has a carnal, superficial crush on [[Talia]] (despite her being nearly four times his height), though this somewhat changes after he stays with her during an assignment from his job.

Avoyt can speak both [[Yarla]] and [[Rudi]] fluently.
## Appearance
Avoyt is a small [[router]] with long, slightly bowed, lightly-colored horns that run parallel to his body up to his rump. He has four paws. He is black, grey, and white, his fur changing slightly with the seasons. His legs are proportionally somewhat shorter, like a [[Skulker]]. His eyes are a brilliant orange, with a matching marking beneath his left eye. Although rumored to be fake, the marking is in fact real.

He often wears a brown and black scarf and dark [Ruti](Ruti%20Culture.md)-styled cloaks.
## Personality
Avoyt is passionate, personable, and optimistic. He especially enjoys chatting with other [critters](Critter.md) at length about topics he is knowledgeable about. He also enjoys debating for the sake of debate, especially over practically pointless issues. Despite Siarki's concerns over protecting him, Avoyt loves to explore and go out to town with others.

He can be quite egotistical and envious. He loves to talk about his own experiences. Though he is intelligent, he occasionally overestimates what he knows about things, and though he's not afraid to be wrong, he will try to justify why he was wrong about something.

He is a fairly poor planner, preferring to "go with the flow". The Siar government usually has a strict schedule for him; Avoyt ironically likes the rigidity, as he tends to trust other's plans over his own.

Many rumors circulate about Avoyt, often in relation to Siarki's mysterious government. Most are negative, as critters in other nations are typically disdainful or suspicious of Siarki. Though he states otherwise, Avoyt is very self-conscious of these rumors and attempt to disprove them even when it's unnecessary. He would do the same for his wife, Naomi, but she is very rarely the subject of bad rumors.

Avoyt is highly adept at [sequencing](Entrogenesis.md), though he seldom used this skill in his work. He simply was very interested in it. In his free-time, he enjoys creating and viewing art; he often sequences while making art.

Despite his [Ruti](Ruti%20Culture.md) background, Avoyt is better described by [[Yarla culture]].
