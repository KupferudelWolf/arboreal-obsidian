[Critters](Critter.md) are an extremely diverse species. One critter may have antlers, another may have three tails, and another may have mushrooms growing on their legs.

Below lists various **genetic traits** that critters may exhibit. Even if certain genes are active, a critter may not exhibit its associated traits; genetic traits appear to come and go as a critter age. For example, a critter born with one tail may grow three more even years after they reach adulthood. The only exception to this are feet; a critter born with four hooves, for example, will always have four hooves.
## Fur & Skin
All critters have fur of any length. Fur length may be consistent or may naturally vary across the body. (Critters can further trim their fur to their desire.) Fur color and patterns can be pretty much anything and often changes over time at varying rates.

Some critters, especially those with talons, may also have scales, usually on the legs. Rarely, critters will have interconnecting scales that form a shell.
## Legs
Legs vary widely in proportional length. Critters are always digitigrade.

Critters always have at least two pairs of legs but may rarely have more. If these extra limbs connect to the ground, then each set between the front and back legs may be paws, talons, or hooves. Extra limbs can usually move independently.

These limbs may be detached from the ground, though, typically as wings. These wings may facilitate flight if the wings are big enough or the critter is small enough; in this case, flight is usually clumsy and requires a lot of endurance.

Critters may have paws, talons, or hooves. Front feet always match each other, as do hind feet. Hinds are never talons. Fores are rarely hooves unless the hinds are also hooves. Paws always have four toes, talons always have three, and hooves always have two. All are more flexible than their early counterparts.

Front legs may have long flight feathers, though critters can seldom fly with these; at most, they may be able to descend slower when falling if they are small enough. This genetic trait is especially common when the front legs have talons.

The rare [rook gene](Rook.md) causes the hind legs and often tail to merge together, somewhat like a mermaid. Critters with this genetic trait are still able to control legs independently; they just can't separate their legs, as they are connected.
## Face
The muzzle can range from short to long; from blunt to sharp; and from narrow to wide. The stop can range from sharp to smooth.

All critters have whiskers, but many critters' whiskers are too short or thin to see. Whiskers vary widely in length, thickness, and number. Some critters may have additional whiskers on other places of their face, like on their brows.

Eyes can be mostly any color but tend to be red or yellow. Heterochromia – eyes that don't match in color – is fairly common. Multi-colored eyes are uncommon. Pupils may be round or narrow, or somewhere in between; rarely, pupils will be different shapes in each eye. Rectangular pupils are uncommon. Pupils can also vary in size.

Multiple eyes are rare. Additional eyes are almost always smaller and weaker than the main eyes, and they almost always move dependently from one of the main eye never can move independently of one of the main eyes. Eyes are always on the face.

Noses usually resemble earthly canines or felines. Critters do have a great sense of smell, though those earthly animals still have a stronger sense. A set of genes may cause a "blended nose" with elongated nostrils, the surrounding flesh often indiscernible from the rest of the muzzle, somewhat like a deer.
## Teeth
Critters usually have 42 teeth but may rarely be born with fewer or more. Jaws are always symmetrical down the muzzle. Teeth are always fit for a mesocarnivore and follow a ratio of roughly 1 canine to 3 incisors to 4 premolars to 2 molars, with remaining teeth typically on the lower jaw.

A single gene may cause longer upper canines when active; this often causes the two teeth to poke out from the mouth. The length of these canines seem to correlate with the size of the critter's tail when this gene is active. Other genes may cause other teeth to grow larger or longer.
## Tail
All critters have at least one tail. It varies from a short nub to a tail larger than the critter's own body. Tails are considered "massive" if they are longer than the critter's shoulder height.

Critters with massive tails almost always have only one tail. Otherwise, critters may have more, with lower numbers more common than higher numbers, and odd numbers more common than even. Critters with longer tails are more likely to have more tails, as long as their tail isn't massive. The known maximum limit is 8 tails, although various legends tell of critters and gods with up to 12.

One tail is physically the "primary" tail, while others are "auxiliary" tails. In most cases, the primary tail can only be identified by observing the critter's skeleton. The primary tail is connected directly to the rest of the spine while the auxiliary tails branch at the sacral vertebrae. These vertebrae can naturally curve, however; the primary tail is thus not always the middle tail.

Critters can typically control their tails independently from each other to some degree; they can always control at least their primary tail (barring injury). Critters with more tails are slightly less likely to have control of each one. Critters born without control of all of their tails typically gain control as they age.

Like the rest of the body, tails can be patterned in any way. Most often, a tail matches the rest of the body. The tip of a tail usually contrasts in color with the rest of that tail. In cases of multiple tails, the tails almost always match each other, though individual tails may temporarily mismatch after shedding.
## Horns
Many critters have boney growths on their head. Typically, they have one or two if any, but some can have as many as six. These horns are made of both bone and keratin, and they grow continuously throughout the critter's life, sometimes even requiring surgery to shorten.

Horns usually curve to some degree. They cannot branch as they are each one continuous bone, though they can run in parallel and split from each other at a point to resemble branching.

Horns are extremely helpful for [[entrogenesis]] as they can allow the critter to sense perturbations in the entropic field.
### Antlers
Antlers are like horns, except they are entirely bone, they can be shed, and they can branch. Antlers are mostly unique to the [[Arboreal River Valley]]; the trait did not naturally develop anywhere else.

Antlers are a lot more fragile than horns. They still hurt when broken unless they were soon to be shed anyway.

Like horns, antlers can facilitate entrogenesis; they are stronger at sensing the entropic field than horns, and usually have greater surface area.
## Growths
Critters may grow otherwise unusual parts. These fall under two categories:
- **Mimicry growths**. These include growths that resemble plants or rocks, even in composition.
- **Defensive growths**. These include growths like quills and spikes, as well as aforementioned horns and shells.
