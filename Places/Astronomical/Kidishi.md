## Satellites
Kidishi has 6 major moons, 8 classical moonlets, and countless more smaller moonlets. All major moons are tidally locked to Kidishi; they always face the planet.

Kidishi also has a ring system that visibly spans in altitude from 141 km to 18,351 km. The three innermost moonlets orbit within these rings, causing the ring’s largest gaps, while the three innermost major moons shepherd the rings. These rings are composed mostly of silicates.

The three inner, smaller moons of the Kidish moon system orbit in resonance to each other. For every three orbits [[{MOON_3}]] completes, [[{MOON_2}]] completes five orbits, and [[{MOON_1}]] completes seven. {MOON_1} is in a stationary orbit as well, appearing mostly still in the sky. These three moons align every 46.7d$_E$, or precisely 35d$_K$ / 1m$_K$.

The three outer moons are far larger and more spaced out. [[{MOON_4}]] is known for its seemingly metallic sheen, while [[{MOON_5}]] is strikingly bright due to its icy surface. The largest moon of all, [[{MOON_6}]], has its own carbon dioxide atmosphere.

Lastly, Kidishi has countless additional asteroids orbiting it, which are known as moonlets. Three of them orbit within Kidishi’s rings as shepherd moons, forming gaps in the rings, while the other moonlets orbit between [[{MOON_5}]] and [[{MOON_6}]]. Five of those outer moonlets are easily visible from the surface of Kidishi; these and the three ring moonlets are recognized as the eight classical moonlets. The innermost one is not visible from the Arboreal River Valley and was thus unknown until modern times.

The three innermost classical moonlets are walnut-shaped; each were formed when two smaller moonlets collided. These moonlets create large gaps in Kidishi’s rings, with the middle moonlet orbiting within the largest gap.
