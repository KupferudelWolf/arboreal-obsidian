The Arboreal River Valley is a glacial valley that spans from approximately ??° ?’ N, ??° ??’ W to ??° ??’ N, ??° ??' W. It is split in half by a large, serpentine river. The [[Mitigali Mountains]] stand to the west, the [[Daxya Mountains]] stand to the east, the [[Teumessian Sea]] (or Lake Teumessian) covers most of the southern edge, and glaciers block the north. The region is dominated by taiga and tundra. Northbound warm air and southbound cold air converge over the Teumessian Sea, causing frequent rain and storms over the southern part of the valley. The eponymous [[Arboreal River]] empties into the Teumessian Sea, which itself empties into the ocean.

Most of the region’s habitable land is taiga. The foliage here, like in most of the world, may be purple, red, orange, yellow, or white, and often resembles Earthly ferns and coniferous trees, regardless of size.

The cliffs of the mountain ranges are steep, with talus formations at each one’s base. The eastern Daxya Mountains are softer, made of limestone, and thus have numerous caves all over its wall. The western Mitigali Mountains are much harder, though the moderate seismic activity leads to natural hot springs: a reward to anyone tough enough to scale the harsh cliffs.

Both mountain ranges have a small strip of land separating them from the Teumessian Sea. The eastern strip is very swampy and damp, while the western strip is more like the rest of the southern region.
## Nations
Critters have organized themselves into six nations within this region: [[Arbor]], [[Siarki]], [[Destora]], the [[Northern Forest Alliance]], and [[Dhonharo]]. Some critters do not live in any nation, however, but instead remain independent. Three additional nations, [[Glyphi]], [[Handak]], and [[Harleigh]], formerly existed within the valley prior to most modern nations.

When the [[Teumessian Conflict]] began and Destora was founded, all five nations formed the [[Arboreal River Coalition]]. They remain loosely unified in this to ensure progression and safety for all critters in the regions.

Rails and shipping routes connect these nations along the Arboreal River and the Teumessian Sea’s west coast.
