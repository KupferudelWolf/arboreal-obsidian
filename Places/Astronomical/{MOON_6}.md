{MOON_6} is the largest and outermost [Kidish](Kidishi.md) moon. It orbits retrograde and holds a significant atmosphere of carbon dioxide and nitrogen. It also has an iron core and its own magnetic field, but it lacks water. The surface constantly experiences high winds and dust storms.

Due to its strange composition and orbit, this moon is almost certainly a captured body.

Historically, critters always viewed this moon as a mirror of Kidishi, as though it were another planet. They commonly mistook the dark flood basalts as lakes when observing {MOON_6} through a telescope. Even in the time period of Arboreal, critters consider the moon to be "likely" inhabited by other critters, as they are not yet aware of the moonâ€™s lack of oxygen and water.
