**Jackie** ([[Yarla]]: **Dakhi**) is a large [Ludi](Ludi Culture) [[critter]] who lives in [[Westcradle]] but travels the northwestern parts of the [[Arboreal River Valley]]. She is one of the four [aetherwolves](Aetherwolf.md).

Jackie is known to speak [[Rudi]] and at least understand [[Yarla]].
## Appearance
Jackie is a large, imposing [[router]] with incredibly black fur and piercing yellow eyes. She has black feathers on her head and neck, as well as white and silver flowers growing from her neck. She has four paws.

She has enormous wings capable of lifting her in the air despite her large form. Unlike most critters, these wings are detached from her front legs; rather, they are a third set of appendages, which are attached to her back. Her flight is clumsy due to her size, especially during takeoff.

Jackie wears silver earrings, each with three circles representing [[Kidishi]]'s three inner moons. She often carries a lantern with her. She sometimes wears bags that she conceals beneath her wings.
## Personality
Jackie is quiet, stern, wise, and intelligent. She is highly dedicated to her beliefs and goals.

She exists almost entirely in rumors between critters in the [[Northern Forest Alliance]] due to her mysterious hermit-like nature; stories tell of her gusting away attackers with her wings or even blowing clouds out of the sky. Some believe she is a spirit of protection or a messenger from the [Aetherian](Aetherianism.md) god Le≈ïindes, and that her lantern protects all within its light. While these may not be true, she is very protective of those she believe to have a good heart, and she does enjoy leading lost critters home.

She has a soft spot for hatchlings and dreams of having her own, but she has no interest in having intercourse.

Jackie loves to live nomadically, hunting and gathering instead of settling down. She is an immensely skilled [sequencer](Entrogenesis.md); she uses her skills to hunt.
