The Ruti culture practiced in [[Siarki]], as well as [[Dhonharo]] and [[Arbor]] to a limited extent, has deviated from its [traditional roots in the north](Ludi%20Culture.md), though the Ruti culture is still associated with the [[Rudi]] language. Since most Ruti critters are from Siarki, [[Kashadism]] is by far the most common religion in southern Ruti culture.

This culture is most resistant against using the base-6 number system over their traditional base-8 system.
## Fashion
Ruti critters usually wear soft robes and cloaks strapped loosely to the body. Jewelry is popular with many Ruti critters, though it is not nearly as prominent as it is in [Yarla culture](Yarla%20Culture.md). The chest is usually concealed, and the belly may be concealed in certain regions of the valley. Like in the north, hats are rare; the ears are seldom obscured.
## Art
Ruti art is similar to that of their northern ancestors. They especially value architecture. Feats of science and engineering are viewed as art as well, with scientists, engineers, artists, and designers all viewed as equally creative and ingenious.
