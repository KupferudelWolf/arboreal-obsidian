Skil is the primary currency of the nations within the [[Arboreal River Coalition]], with the exception of certain states of the [[Northern Forest Alliance]].

## History
x

Vanadium was smelted into coins valued based on purity. At first, the shape was rough; it ranged from flat disks to round spheres. As long as it had a smith's emblem on it, it was valid. [[Siarki]] was the first to standardized the currency and the first to open a mint: at the time, a smith dedicated solely to the production of currency. They created the saucer-like shape the coins still have today, though the hole in the center would come later.

These coins initially composed of vanadium or vanadium-iron alloys. Their value remained based on purity, though with official Siar seals denoting their value. The complex shape and composition inherently made counterfeiting difficult, though not impossible.

Over time, the coins would oxidize or rust, changing the silvery colors to gold, then dark brown. This would naturally deprecate the value of the coin, which happened to help avoid inflation. However, the currency faced the opposite problem – deflation – as the need for vanadium and vanadinite byproducts increased with steel production. The [[Teumessian Conflict]] only exasperated this. Siarki attempted to mitigate this by using less and less vanadium and iron, introducing a hole in the center of the coin for stringing the coins together and for saving on materials.

Over time, the skil became a commodity currency; it directly related to the local value of vanadium. Coins remained the same shape. The center of the coins were still made of various vanadium alloys at the edges and the hole, with other metals, such as copper or silver, in the center. Denominations increased with the apparent color of the central metal, chosen intentionally to mimic the oxidation stages of vanadium.

The skil is still based on vanadium, but now as a representative currency; coins typically contain no vanadium, though they may contain more valuable metals such as silver. Stone-paper bills exist as representative bills, but these are bills purchased at a bank for larger transfers; the coins remain the primarily exchanged form of skil.

With global trade increasing, however, the skil is rapidly moving toward a fiat currency: one that Siarki thoroughly controls without the need of vanadium. This would free up vanadium stores for production. [[Destora]] and [[Arbor]] have been stunting this transition, however, as the highly capitalist Destora – an adversary of Siarki – relies heavily on the value of skil.
