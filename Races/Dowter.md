The **dowter** ([[Yarla]]: **dachi**) race most closely resembles the earthly lynx or possibly hyena.
## Appearance
Dowters are small or medium and have short tails. They are usually, though not always, stocky. Spotted or striped fur patterns are common, as are sharp ears.

The main difference between dowters and [sleuths](Sleuth.md) is the sharp ears and the sleuth's larger size, though many critters fall in between the extremes. For such critters without spots or stripes, this line is very, very blurry.
## Perception
Historically, dowters were associated with [[Handak]], as most Handak monarchs were dowters. More specifically, Handak monarchs were primarily from [[Dowti]]-speaking families.

As a result, dowters are seen at worst as prudish and egotistical. Society generally expects them to be proper, mature, and composed.

More recently, the term "clowter" (Yarla: **khidachi**) has risen to describe dowters who do not act like how dowters are expected. The term especially applies to younger dowters, but in general applies to any dowt when they do not appear or act like royalty.
