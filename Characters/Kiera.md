**Kiera** ([[Yarla]]: **Khi≈ïe**) is an adult [[critter]] residing in [[Doveport]]. She is one of [[Aspen]]'s friends.

Kiera speaks [[Yarla]] and an adequate amount of [[Rudi]]. She also knows how to read some [[Dowti]] and has a lot of interest in [[Glyphi]], despite both of those languages being dead.
## Appearance
Kiera is a medium-sized [[skulker]] with an intricate brown, grey, and orange pelt. She has talons in the front and paws in the back. Her feathers are a very dark but iridescent ultraviolet-black. She is fairly fit. Her talons are somewhat thick. She has large feathers attached to her mostly furry front legs, narrow feathers on her rump, and small feathers down the top of her tail. Her eyes are yellow and have narrow pupils. She has prominent whiskers.

She doesn't wear much beyond the occasional necklace or bag, though she later starts wearing [Ruti](Ruti%20Culture.md) cloaks.
## Personality
Keira is intelligent, talkative, and eager. She is quick to jump to conclusions or make assumptions, though in general, her intuition serves her well. She habitatually correct others when they say something she knows to be inaccurate. This results in her being overly honest when unnecessary; she is so bad at white lies that other critters can't make them around her.

In debate, she hates being wrong and will defend herself or make excuses when something she says doesn't like up. She is self-conscious about this, though, and will usually try to apologize or admit her mistake later.

Keira's biggest dream is to be accepted into the prestigious [[University Siarki]] to study mathematics (though this later changes to archeology). As a result, she somewhat idolizes [[Siarki]] and occasionally defends it against criticism. Though she is clearly of [[Yarla culture]], she likes to act like a [Ruti](Ruti%20Culture.md) critter. Whether she genuinely loves Siarki or only does this to better her chances of admission is unclear. She does not practice [[Kashadism]], however, and rarely speaks on its behalf.

Kiera enjoys sports, especially climbing.
## Backstory
Kiera was born in Doveport. She fell in love with science and math at a young age.
