**Lunathros** ([[Yarla]]: **Yonyer≈ïos**) is an adult immigrant [[critter]] residing in [[Doveport]]. She is one of [[Aspen]]'s friends.

She speaks [[Yarla]] fairly well, she can speak broken [[Shuthl]] but understand it well, and she can understand some Rudi.
## Appearance
Lunathros is a very brightly white [[skulker]] with dark and light bluish-ultraviolet markings. (These appear as black and bluish-grey in the webcomic.) She has four paws. Her eyes are a bright cyan and have narrow pupils. She has prominent whiskers of average length, and she has somewhat long upper canines that protrude from her mouth.

She tends to wear leather bags around her neck, body, and rump. Various trinkets dangle from her bags. She wears a thin, light, transparent cowl over her neck and chest. She loves wearing glitter in her fur.
## Personality
Lunathros is naive, dreamy, kind, and gentle. She has a passing interest in many things; she easily gets passionate about new or interesting topics. She is quite spiritual, though she is willing to adjust her beliefs to fit emperical evidence that otherwise contradicts them.

Her culture is mixed, with influence from [Shuthl](Shuthl%20Culture.md), [Yarla](Yarla%20Culture.md), [Ludi](Ludi%20Culture.md), and even [Ridhil](Ridhil%20Culture) cultures. Overall, she feels very lost and out-of-place; she wants most to find a place where she feels she belongs.

She can occasionally be moody, though she is practically never angry. She has periodic depressive episodes where she feels alone and hopeless. Usually, being with friends helps her, but when she is feeling depressed, she fears reaching out would somehow upset or inconvenience her friends. Later in the story, she starts seeing a therapist and improving.
## Backstory
Lunathros moved from [[Riveria]] to [[Arbor]] with her family when she was a hatchling. She doesn't remember anything about her birthplace. Her parents, although closer to Shuthl culture, were entranced by the river valley's cultures and wanted to raise Lunathros as though she were natively born.
