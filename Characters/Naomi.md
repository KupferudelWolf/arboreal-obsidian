**Naomi** ([[Yarla]]: **Nayonni**) is an adult [[critter]] residing in the city of [[Siarki]]. She is known for her case of [[Entropic Burst Disorder]].

She is happily married to [[Avoyt]].

She speaks [[Rudi]] and broken [[Yarla]].
## Appearance
Naomi is a small brown and tan [[skulker]] with grey cheeks. Her tail's tan tip reaches and drags on the ground, meaning it is technically considered massive. She has especially prominent and long whiskers. Her eyes are a dark red and have narrow pupils.
## Personality
Naomi is a clever, shy, and intelligent critter of [[Ruti culture]]. She is quiet; when she speaks, she is clear and concise. She hides nervousness and anxiety well around strangers. She is an adept liar, but not a habitual one; she usually only lies to protect herself and others, especially from persecution.

Like her husband, she can be quite jealous of others. She has become somewhat comfortable with her husband's superficial interest in [[Talia]]: partly because she is confident in Avoyt's interest in her, but mostly because she knows Talia would probably physically crush him at his size.

She dislikes having attention, causing issues with her husband: an ambassador and public figure for the [Siar](Siarki.md) government. Fortunately, her public image is mostly positive, with some critters even believing she deserves a "better" partner.

Her [[Entropic Burst Disorder]] manifests in her sneezes. Every time she sneezes, she releases entropic energy, rapidly changing parts of her surroundings to various degrees. These changes may require a [sequencer](Entrogenesis.md) to repair. She usually sneezes twice in a row.
