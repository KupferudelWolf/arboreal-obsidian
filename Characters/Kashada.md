**Kashada** ([[Yarla]]: **Khashada** or occasionally **Khasda**) is a glass-encased mechanical robot built by a mysterious scientist over a century ago. She is the prophet of [[Kashadism]].

Despite having been made during the [[Steam Age]], Kashada exhibits self-awareness. Little is known about her creator or her inner workings. Even the curious [Siar](Siarki.md) scientists refuse to disassemble her in fear of breaking her.

For unknown reasons, Siar government officials responsible for her care refuse to admit she is a robot, instead insisting she is just a [[critter]]. No follower of Kashada seems to believe this, though some critics of Kashadism independently believe that she may not be a robot at all.
## Appearance
Kashada consists of countless gears and other moving parts suspended in a thick clear oil within a thick [[router]]-shaped glass vessel. Her eyes glow a deep blue. She seems to have four paws, though her toes are not articulated.

Siar officials often dress her in artificial pelts. When decorated, she is white with sparse grey and black markings. According to rumors, she chose this look herself.
