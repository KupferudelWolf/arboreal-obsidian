A **rangler** ([[Yarla]]: **ranlar**) is a [[critter]] who resembles a smaller earthly artiodact, such as the deer. They are uncommon, but fairly prominent in the northeast.
## Appearance
Any critter with four hooves is considered a rangler unless they are both large and have horns. Critters with hind hooves and front talons are often considered ranglers too, especially if they have a blended nose.

Due to [genetics](Genetic%20Traits.md), critters with four hooves practically always have a blended nose and usually have antlers.
## Perception
Historically, ranglers were associated with [[Handak]] and [[Harleigh]]: two nations that no longer exist, due at least in part to the [[Northern Forest Alliance]]. At the time, they were seen as adversaries of the [[router]]- and [[bard]]-dominant N.F.A. Over time, though, racial conflict dissolved; by the time of the [[Teumessian Conflict]], the races were at peace with each other.

Today, the general public makes few subconscious assumptions about ranglers. The main inaccuracy, which only occasionally comes up, is that a rangler necessarily has Handak or Harleigh ancestors, or that a non-rangler does not; this is false.
