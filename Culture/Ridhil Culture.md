The Ridhil culture originates south of the [[Arboreal River Valley]]. It is tied to nomadic groups that traveled up the western side of the [[Teumessian Sea]].

[[Rudi]] and [[Yarla]] are common languages for Ridhil critters; they are not associated with their own language.
## Spirituality
Ridhil is not associated with any religions in particular. Rather, Ridhil critters are highly spiritual and superstitious. Spirits are a fact of life to most Ridhil critters; rejecting their existence is like rejecting the existence of water itself.

Different Ridhil groups will have different spiritual beliefs with different numbers of spirits, but the spirits they believe in often fall into one of four categories:
- Water, smoke, or fog spirits: live within water / smoke / fog, or allow water to flow; usually, stagnation and laziness weakens, harms, or angers these spirits.
- Ground spirits: entities deep underground that appreciate scents, beauty, art, or music.
- Life spirits: associated with growth, and often with balance, especially between good and bad.
- Night spirits: mischievous jokesters, often associated with the dark.
- Water, smoke, or fog spirits are most common; all Ridhil spiritual traditions involve at least one such spirit.
In practically all cases, spirits are meant to be appeased; how this is done depends on the individual spirit. Sacrifices to the spirit, usually done through work or dedicated time, are believed to bring luck or success.
## Fashion
Ridhil culture heavily emphasizes fashion. They tend to wear tight, practical, almost militaristic attire, along with large, intricate, or even gaudy hats.
## Entertainment
Ridhil critters highly value "doing" over all. Camping, hiking, and climbing are immensely popular, though often, even manual work satisfies them.
