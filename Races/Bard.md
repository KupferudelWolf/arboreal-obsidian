A **bard** ([[Yarla]]: **yart**) is a race of [critters](Critters.md) who roughly resemble earthly coyotes. They are historically associated with Yarla culture, though present-day bards may be of any culture.
## Appearance
The stereotypical bard is lanky and has sharp features, especially triangular ears. They typically have intricate pelts with three or more different colors.
## Perception
Bards who are overweight are more often seen as overweight than other races, as they are generally expected to be thin. Often, a bard is expected to show interest in sports or the arts despite their career. These are popular subjects in a lot of the [[Arboreal River Valley]], though, so this association may be more to do with the valley as a whole.

Historically, bards preferred to work as couriers, scribes, and cartographers. The primarily language in the region, [[Yarla]], is in fact named after them; the [[Arboreal Common]] word for the race originally just meant "scribe" or "storyteller", and the original word for written language roughly translated to "scribe speak".
