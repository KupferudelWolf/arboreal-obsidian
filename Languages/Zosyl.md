Zosyl (/ˈʒɤʃjəl̠/) is a relative of [[Shuthl]]; it is not endemic to the [[Arboreal River Valley]] and is only spoken by some immigrants.

Zosyl uses an alphabet very similar to that of Shuthl, though the letterforms are usually written much shorter. Zosyl’s writing system is thus also an abjad, though it much less frequently marks vowels.

Zosyl is the native language of the main character of Arboreal, [[Aspen]], although she is fluent in [[Yarla]]. Aspen’s in-universe name, Shenoŕ (Yarla: Shenoŕ /ʂɘˈɳɤɽ/), is based on her birth name, Znōr (/ʒəˈnʊːɾ/): the Zosyl word for a species of white-barked tree common in her birthplace.
