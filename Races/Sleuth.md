A **sleuth** is a [[critter]] who resembles an earthly bear. They are somewhat associated with [[Ludi culture]].
## Appearance
Sleuths are large and exceptionally stocky. They have blunt muzzles and short tails like [dowters](Dowter.md), but are larger and with rounder ears.

There seems to be no particular pelt colors or patterns associated with the race, though critters with spots or stripe tend to be viewed as [dowters](Dowter).
## Perception
Sleuths tend to live outside of cities, usually on their own. They have historically dominated workspaces for practical jobs such as smithing, mining, and construction due to their size.

Society expects sleuths to either be strong, or be fat and lazy; there is no middle ground. This association is weak, however, and is disappearing over time, especially as jobs like manufacturing become automated.
