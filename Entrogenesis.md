The "magic system" of Arboreal is called entrogenesis. Performing this power, or sequencing, involves the caster – the sequencer – "tugging" an object to change in a certain way using focus and willpower. Meta-wise, it is a magic system, but to a [[critter]], it is just as much a scientific field as electricity.

Entrogenesis is based on entropy. In the universe of Arboreal, there exists a vector field, much like electromagnetism, that dictates how the objects it represents progresses through time. In a way, this entropic field "tells entropy how to affect things" or "tells things how to change over time".

For this reason, entrogenesis is limited in its capabilities by time; when, for example, changing the color of one’s fur, the fur still needs time to change into this new color. The most powerful sequencers may be able to reduce this time closer to zero, but this is extremely difficult for even the simplest uses.

The scientific study of entrogenesis is entrogenetics: a misnomer, as even critters now understand it has nothing to do with genetics. It finds a lot of use in science, manufacturing, construction, medical practices, and agriculture.
## Sequencing
In short, sequencing is like "spellcasting".

Technically, entrogenesis occurs whenever two things physically interact. The practice of intentionally manipulating this field to achieve a certain goal is called entropic sequencing, or just sequencing.

Critters may have a synesthesia-like sense for the state of the entropic field. Some see auras, some feel tingling, some smell or even taste it. In almost all cases, critters with this sense have antlers, horns, or tusks, and their sensitivity to the field is directly proportional to that feature’s surface area. Critters without this sense may use a bone (such as a shed antler tine) as a wand, dowsing for fluctuations in the entropic field. (Strangely, any bone works, not just those of a critter. This implies that animals are capable of sensing the entropic field.) Some critters claim they can sense better with a wand if they have their teeth exposed or are holding the wand in their teeth, though this is highly disputed.

Despite this, critters do not need antlers, horns, tusks, or a wand to sequence. They in fact do not even need to know how entrogenesis works; in fact, no critter has fully discovered how it works so far. Many actions alter the entropic field in relatively consistent ways, so a critter only needs to learn to perform certain actions. Being able to sense the entropic field does help, however, since the critter can tell if something is off and correct it.

A lot of sequencing is in willpower. A critter can, in a sense, project their essence or "spark" onto their target through focus and concentration. They can then "pull" the points of the entropic field in the direction they need. This seems to only work if the sequencer is observing the target in some way. This method of sequencing, while older than history, has yet to be understood.
## Elements
In classical entrogenetics, critters believed that all objects have a DNA-like makeup of four elements, which were defined based on which direction the entropic field would pull a wand. In reality, their wands detect the directional forces of a point on the entropic field associated with that object in that space and time. In modern day, they still do not have a full understanding of this.

In the [[Arboreal River Valley]], these elements, and the directions associated with them, were sky (upward), ground (downward), warm (leftward), and cold (rightward). This mostly came from associations; wood on fire, for example, tends to tug the wand to the left. Though these archaic elements are comparable to the Earthly classical elements, water is considered warm, not cold.
