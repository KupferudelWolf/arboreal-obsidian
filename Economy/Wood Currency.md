In some states of the [[Northern Forest Alliance]], wood serves as the basis for economic value rather than vanadium (like [[Skil]]). The currencies operate in one of two ways, depending on the state: by the amount of physical wood in storage (commodity), or by the amount of labor produced through woodcutting.

Wood currencies are very seldom directly traded. Rather, they are often used to record barter transactions to determine fair trade. The currency is still a currency, with minted coins; critters just prefer barter, and local governments are only concerned with recording, not mandating, intrinsic value. These currencies are highly volatile as a result, with conversion rates between each other or to skil in extreme flux. [[Ptarma]] as a result handles all skil transactions, mostly for exporting resources.

Physical coins are, naturally, made of wood, with highly detailed (and sometimes even microscopic) markings that vary between nations. Many of these coins are bordered with cheap metal alloys (often containing copper) to help communicate and stabilize their value, as well as to simply make the coins appealing. The artistic aspect of these currencies are often emphasized; this is due to spiritual beliefs or traditions, though it may also be to entice critters to use coins rather than direct barter.
