# Arboreal
## Synopsis
Arboreal is a science fantasy xenofiction about the [inhabitants](Critter) of the [[Arboreal River Valley]]: a northern region on the alien planet of [[Kidishi]].
## Setting
On a distant world of red trees and many moons thrives an alien species called critters. They resemble various earthly animals, yet they are [very chimerical](Genetic%20Traits.md) in appearance; horns, feathers, extra tails, and spines are the usual.
## Purpose
This world serves as the setting for my webcomic. I plan to run this webcomic to improve my art and discipline. Many aspects of the universe of Arboreal were chosen based on my personal preferences.
The webcomic will be written first in [[Yarla]], then translated into English. This will (intentionally) lead to a few strange translation errors.
## Story
One critter, a [[Skulker]] (that is, a fox-like critter) named [[Aspen]], recently moved to [[Doveport]]: the largest city of the [[Arboreal River Valley]], known as the golden city of opportunity and the melting pot of the valley. Will she flourish in this new region? Who will she meet? Will she like Doveport's famous apple pizza?
In-universe, the artist of the webcomic is a [[router]] named [[Tselye]], who is writing this 65 calendar years (about an Earth century) after it takes place, as a historical fiction / slice-of-life comic. The unnamed translator acts as some kind of mysterious mediator between Kidishi and Earth; he is an avid fan of the comic, so he wishes to share it with Earth. Meta-wise, I receive them and pass them off as my own work; when I say, for example, I made these characters, within the context of the story, I am lying. ;3
## Notes
### Time Period
All content in this wiki, unless otherwise specified, is from the perspective and time frame of the webcomic's setting. "Modern time", for example, refers to the time period in the webcomic, not the time period of the artist (approximately 100 earth-years after the setting).
### Accuracy
As the webcomic is fiction even in the context of the artist, the story contains some historical inaccuracies. This wiki is from the perspective of the webcomic's setting, so facts are based on the webcomic's setting, not on Kidishi's true history. For example, the webcomic commonly refers to places as unclaimed, especially atop the mountain ranges west and east of the river valley. In reality, all land, even atop the mountains, was politically claimed at the time of the webcomic.

As it serves the artist's world as historic fiction, though, it does not deviate often from her reality; inconsistencies usually arise from either artistic choice or simple misinformation and mistakes.
