Rudi is the oldest language still spoken in the [[Arboreal River Valley]]. It branched from [[Arboreal Common]] separately from [[Yarla]]. Contrastingly to Yarla, Rudi became more gestural, to the point that most everyday sentences are spoken with the body, not with the mouth.

However, inventions like the radio and the telephone have challenged this, as speakers can no longer visibly see each other. Conscious efforts to solve this range from remotely controlled "puppets" to simply describing the motions in a sort of "code"; none have been widely adopted. Instead, several pidgin languages combining Yarla and Rudi have emerged; these are collectively known as "radio-speak".
## Phonetics
As a lot of the Ruti language involves gestures, its phonetic inventory is small.

x

The phoneme /???/ represents an "initializing particle": usually, a bark-like sound that denotes modality and grabs attention (so that the speaker will watch their body language). This sound highly varies between individuals, however; its tone is interpreted, not its actual sound.
### Accents
Since this phonetic inventory is so small, Rudi speakers are very lenient about how they realize phonemes. In fact, the language’s name itself is based on the Siar pronunciation of "rudi" \[ɾɤɖi], rather than the received pronunciation of "luti" \[ˈloːʈɪ]. The accent varies enough that some speakers may not understand each other’s spoken words; [[Tunora]] speakers, for example, struggle to understand [[Aurora]] speakers by voice alone.

The [[Ptarma]] accent is considered the standard Rudi pronunciation:

### Body Language
While utterances in Rudi are very basic, gestures are incredibly complex. It is important to define body language, as without it, Rudi is completely unintelligible.

Rudi uses 7 head gestures, 13 ear gestures, 3 eye gestures, and 1 lip gesture (each excluding neutral positions). Gestures range in speed; some cultures (especially in cities) speak faster, seen by others as "fidgety", while other cultures (especially near the [[Mitigali Mountains]]) speak slower, seen by others as "flowy".

Historically, if a critter lacks both ears and a tail, they were simply incapable of speaking Rudi; if a critter is blind, they were incapable of listening. In modern times, radio-speak has incidentally given these critters a solution to their impairments.

Meta-wise, when showing Rudi gloss, gestures will be shown in their own row.
#### Head
Critters can move their head along three axes, though the Rudi language only uses two:
- The pitch axis nods their muzzle downward (negative) or upward (positive). Rudi encodes information in the direction as well as the speed of realization. Motion may also be realized or emphasized with an inward lateral movement; if the speaker does not also nod, then the other critter must rely on context clues.
- The roll axis tilts the head to the speaker’s left (negative) or right (positive). Rudi does not distinguish left from right.
- The yaw axis moves the head to the speaker’s left (negative) or right (positive). Rudi does not use this axis, though some speakers use the yaw axis in place of the roll axis when their ears' pinna axis is negative.
The pitch axis is labeled “X”, and the roll axis is labeled “Y”. The roll axis does not differentiate left and right; the head is either tilted or not tilted. The pitch axis’s direction and speed both matter, however; the gesture is marked “−”/”+” if it is a quick nod, or “=”/”‡” if it is a longer nod. For example, {X=,Y} means the speaker nods diagonally down.

The head gestures used in Ruti are therefore:

#### Ears
Ruti speakers "speak" most with their ears, moving them along two axes:
- The apex axis can point the ear upward, stressing the lateral side (negative), or outward, stressing the medial side (positive). This changes the direction that the tip of the ear – the apex – points.
- The pinna axis can spin the ear backwards (negative) or forwards (positive). This changes how much of the inside of the ear – the pinna – that the viewer sees.

In Rudi, an ear "utterance" is made by flicking one or both ears. The left and right ears are not distinguished, though flicking both is different from flicking one.

The ear gestures used in Ruti are:

##### Tail
If a critter lacks ears or has their ears covered, or if they simply prefer to, then they may use their tail. In many cases, a Rudi speaker may use both their ears and tail in tandem, especially if they are invested in the conversation.

If a critter has multiple tails, they typically gesture with all tails; few critters are capable of moving their tails independently. Critters with four or more tails often forego tail movements altogether, as do critters with short or massive tails.

The tail has three axes, of which Rudi usually uses two:
- The lateral axis moves the tail to the left or the right, at the ankle or further outward. In Rudi, the speaker either flicks just the tip of the tail or wags the whole tail. This corresponds to the apex axis of the ears, with one side denoting one ear, and the other denoting both ears. Usually, the direction denoting one ear is the direction of the hip facing away from the target. Regardless, a critter can typically deduct which side means what based on context clues.
- The flag axis points the tip upward or downward. This corresponds to the pinna axis of the ears, with the tail flicking somewhat up denoting positive pinna.
- The ??? axis moves the tail between the legs, lifts it upward, or even curls it onto the speaker’s back. Rudi speakers may use this to emphasize the flag axis point.
#### Lips
Rudi speakers may raise their lips to bare teeth.
#### Eyes

## Writing
Like its ancestor, [[Ancient Glyphics]], Rudi has a logographic writing system. It combines just over 100 base glyphs, each with two or three forms, to create words. Whether parts of a grapheme represent a sound, a gesture, or something about the word is very inconsistent.
