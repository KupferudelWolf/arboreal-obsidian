A **harrier** is a [[critter]] who resembles larger earthly artiodacts, such as the moose.
## Appearance
For the most part, harriers are large critters with four hooves and either antlers or horns. These horns are usually large and intricate. If a critter is not large or lack horns, they are considered a [[rangler]]; if they do not have four hooves, they are likely to be seen as a [[router]] or a [[sleuth]].

Due to [genetics](Genetic%20Traits.md), critters with four hooves practically always have a blended nose and usually have antlers.
## Perception
Harriers are seen as strong and aggressive. An angry harrier is judged more for an outburst than a non-critter would be. This perception is somewhat primal; harriers are large and imposing, with hooves and horns that could break bones. This perception is, however, hardly present in natives of the [[Arboreal River Valley]], as harriers have lived alongside critters for a long time.

More recent views of harriers have in fact painted harriers as nerds of sorts, especially if the critter in question doesn't look or act aggressive. This is mostly due to the rise of nerd culture and the apparent prominence of harrier participants.

Antlers in particular are rare outside of the region; they are a genetic feature almost exclusive to natives of the river valley. Harriers with antlers are seen as Arboreal natives even if they happen to have been born and raised elsewhere.
