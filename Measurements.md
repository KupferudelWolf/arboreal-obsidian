## Time
A day on [[Kidishi]] lasts about 31.99 Earth hours. The calendar used in all of the [[Arboreal River Valley]] (and practically nowhere else) organizes days into 8-day weeks. A month is the length of time it takes for the three inner moons to align: exactly 35 Kidish days. Twelve months make a calendar year, as twelve is a sacred number in the valley. A full revolution of Kidishi around [[Zhe]] – a true year – takes 10⅔ calendar years (or about 16.3 Earth years); the Arboreal calendar does not recognize a true year, but instead treats seasons as independent periods of time.
## Distance
The [[Arboreal River Valley]] uses a single system for measurement. The base unit of this system, the pawl, is approximately equal to 5.6469 cm (2.2232 in.). (Meta-wise, 1 pawl is exactly 3.49φ cm.)
The smallest unit is a midpawl (1 Lmp). Three midpawls equal a pawl (1 Lp). Three pawls equal a midtail (1 Lmt). Three midtails equal a tail (1 Lt). Nine tails equal a stelp (1 Ls). For example, a critter typically stands about 2.5 tails at the shoulder.

The [Siar](Siarki) government has standardized longer units of distance. 48 stelps equal an arforel (La). 12 aforels equal a forel (Lf). 65,536 forels equal a far-forel (Lff).

Far-forels were created solely to handle astronomical distances, as even the circumference of the entire planet is only just over a quarter of a far-forel. Kidishi orbits around [[Zhe]] at about 8,565 far-forels. Kidishi’s largest and farthest moon, [[{MOON_6}]], is about 21 far-forels from [[Kidishi]]. A lightyear is about 5.469×10$^7$ far-forels.
