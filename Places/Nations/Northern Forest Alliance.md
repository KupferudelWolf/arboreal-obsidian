The N.F.A. consists of ten states: [[Aurora]], [[East Mitiga]], [[Laelapsis]], [[Ptarma]], [[Tunora]], [[{N.F.A. 6}]], [[{N.F.A. 7}]], [[{N.F.A. 8}]], [[Welpia]], and [[Westcradle]]. These states, many of which further divide themselves into subregions, voluntarily participate in this alliance by following its legislation, although they all remain mostly self-governing; in other words, the N.F.A. is a confederation. The alliance no longer recognizes a constitutional law, though each state (except Tunora) enforces its own constitution.

This nation is heavily influenced by more classical [Ruti culture](Ruti%20Culture.md), sometimes called ["Ludi" culture](Ludi%20Culture.md). It is the oldest extant nation in the [[Arboreal River Valley]].
