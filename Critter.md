The intelligent species of the world of [[Kidishi]] is the critter. A critter resembles one of several Earthly mammals, especially those from the northern regions of Earth. This includes wolves, foxes, bears, lynxes, deer, and caribou. Critters may also have attributes like those of earthly birds, especially corvids. Most often, however, a critter will resemble something in between: a wolf with antlers, a lynx with a beak, a moose with talons, and so on. They may even have bizarre features unrelated to their earthly analogues, growing quills, fins, scales, crystals, tendrils, extra appendages, multiple tails, unusual wings, and more!

They vary vastly in size as well, spanning from 0.1 meters to over 9 meters (or, 0.5 feet to over 30 feet)! They are almost always about 1 meter (about 3 feet) tall to the shoulder, however.

Despite this extreme diversity, the critter is a single species. Wolf-like critters and lynx-like critters are both just critters. The offspring of the two would not necessarily resemble a wolf-lynx hybrid; in fact, it’s very possible they could resemble a deer instead!
## Life
Overall, critters live on average for 51 calendar years (about 78-79 Earth years). Through [sequencing](Entrogenesis.md), a critter may live up to 72 calendar years (almost 111 Earth years), though hypothetically, with perfect sequencing, they may live indefinitely.

Despite their genetic diversity, critters do not express much sexual dimorphism; male and female critters are hard to tell apart, even when viewing their...er, birth records. Different cultures handle this in very different ways.

About 3 Kidish days after conception, a critter may lay up to three eggs. After 30 to 45 Kidish days (about 40 to 60 Earth days) of incubation, the newborn critter hatches from the egg.

Hatchlings grow into adults over 11-12 calendar years (about 17-19 Earth years), though some cultures and nations consider adulthood to be earlier or later. During this time, a hatchling may remain with their parents until adulthood, or leave their family as young as 5 calendar years of age (about 7-8 Earth years), depending on the family and their culture.

## Genetic Features

Critters may be born with a wide range of physical traits. These may be present at birth or may appear later in the critter’s life. Typically, a critter may have paws, talons, or hooves; they may frequently have a pair of one type and a pair of another. These never naturally change over a critter’s life, so critters categorize themselves into “clades” based on what kind of limbs they have.

The size of a critter (measured to the shoulder) ranges in height from 0.1 meters (0.5 ft) to over 9 meters (30 ft), and in weight from 1 kg (2 lbs.) to over 9,000 kg (nearly 10 tons). On average, however, a critter is much closer to 0.5 m (1.6 ft.) to 1.5 m (4.9 ft.) tall and 27 kg (60 lbs.) to 243 kg (536 lbs.) in weight. These weights are as they are on Kidishi, which has about 1.13 times the surface gravity of Earth; on Earth, they would weigh on average from 24 kg (53 lbs.) to 216 kg (476 lbs.).

Pelts vary drastically in color and pattern. Eye color is most commonly amber but may be red, orange, yellow, light blue, green, pink, purple, or white. Pelt and eye color may change during a critter’s lifespan, changing sometimes even monthly or weekly.

Common genetic features include: antlers and horns; large whiskers; multiple tails (up to 7); feathers; a shell; fins; quills; scales; wool; a bristled tongue; tusks; and winglets. Antlers are significantly more common in the [[Arboreal River Valley]] than elsewhere in the world.

More uncommon genetic features include: glowing parts; plant or mineral growths; larger, functional wings; a beak in place of a muzzle; and additional parts, such as legs or eyes.

Critters may [sequence](Entrogenesis.md) themselves or each other to change the prominence or nature of genetic features. Removing or adding features, however, is much more difficult and risky. Either way, these additions and subtractions usually take days, weeks, or even months to complete, depending on the skill of the sequencer. They typically do not affect the critter’s actual genetic structure, so the traits are unlikely to be passed down.

Other attributes, such as sex and height, may also be sequenced.
## Races
Races are subjective; they are based on perception, culture, and personal biases. No nation officially recognizes any particular list of races; the distinction is just societal in nature. Additionally, critters sometimes do not fit under a single race; these are more of a spectrum.

Meta-wise, the races distinguished in the webcomic (and below) are those based on specific Earth analogues. The features listed below are stereotypical for each race and may not describe every critter associated with it. These races are:

|Race|Earth Analogue|Size|Hinds|Other Features|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|bard|coyote|tall; lanky|paws|pointed ears; intricate pelts|
|clouter|||paws||
|dowter|lynx; griffin|short to medium|paws|flexible; short tail|
|harrier|moose; muskox|massive|hooves|huge antlers / horns|
|perry|peryton|tall|hooves|patterned pelt|
|rangler|deer|medium to tall|hooves|patterned pelt; antlers / horns|
|reigner|caribou|large|hooves|intricate antlers / horns|
|rook|pinnipeds|short; round|...?|“mermaid” trait|
|router|wolf|medium|paws|bulky; thick neck; round-ish ears|
|skulker|fox; enfield|small to medium|paws|colorful; large tails|
|sleuth|bear|large; round|paws|short tail|
