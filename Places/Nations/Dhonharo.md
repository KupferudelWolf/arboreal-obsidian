Dhonharo inhabits the land south of [[Siarki]] along the strip of non-mountainous land west of the [[Teumessian Sea]], reaching as far south as the mouth of the sea. Their capital, [[Sidhil]], holds most of the nation’s population.
## History
The city of Sidhil began as a settlement for nomadic groups moving north into the [[Arboreal River Valley]]. These nomadic groups had a strong [Ridhil culture](Ridhil%20Culture.md) that is still prominent to this day.

When the Siar guilds formed [[Siarki]], Sidhil grew alongside the new nation. As Siarki's government grew in power, expats and exiles abandoned the city-state, mostly moving to the nearer Sidhil. They often had little or no wealth, but Sidhil gave them easy work, allowing the immigrants to begin building themselves up. At first, many criminally-inclined critters moved into the city as a result, which led to a prominence in sheriffs and even militias; yet, crime rate was never a serious threat, as many of these critters, after being exposed to Ridhil culture, sought to join the workforce and make something of themselves.

Soon before the [[Teumessian Conflict]], Sidhil officially founded the nation of Dhonharo. They expanded both their territory and their industry, forming trade routes with Siarki in exchange for land. This proved auspicious, as, by time the Teumessian Conflict began, Siarki and Dhonharo had established infrastructure.

Dhonharo proved instrumental in protecting the [[Arboreal River Valley]] during the Teumessian Conflict; they provided Siarki with cheap labor, military forces, and transportation, while Siarki provided food and resources. Dhonharo also helped establish the southern garrison of the Teumessian Sea, which kept many invaders outside of the river valley; they still upkeep this garrison to this day.

In modern day, Dhonharo views Siarki as a daughter views her mother; the two are close allies. Siar exiles still prefer Dhonharo, which has systems in place specifically for them, over [[Arbor]], which is much more financially difficult to immigrate into.
## Politics
Dhonharo is very democratic; citizens vote for all political positions as well as service positions. For example, citizens living in a town are given the opportunity to vote on the manager for a planned construction project within the town, the town’s sheriffs, the owner of the post office, the head chef at the local restaurant branch, and so on.
