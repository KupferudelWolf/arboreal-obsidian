Yarla is the most prominent culture in the [[Arboreal River Valley]]. The nations of [[Arbor]], [[Siarki]], and [[Destora]] all have a high number of Yarla citizens; the [[Northern Forest Alliance]] and [[Dhonharo]] both still have a significant Yarla population. The language of Yarla critters is also called [[Yarla]]. Statistically, Yarla critters more often follow [[Aetherianism]], [[Tsitsuyanism]], or the [[Skiln-Kha Religious Movement]].

Outsiders view Yarla critters as very intimate and lax. They often speak with their faces close, and they frequently form family-like groups with their friends called "cliques".
## Greetings
A Yarla greeting is distinct and recognizable. The greeter places a front paw on the other’s chest, or two if they are particularly close. The second critter may place a paw back on the first’s chest to show appreciation or love, or simply nod or bow to show respect. Yarla critters also obligate themselves to offer gifts when meeting a new critter, especially if they are meeting this critter within that critter’s clique. These gifts are often worth very little and may be regifted countless times. Rejecting the gift is considered rude, though regifting the gift is even expected.
## Fashion and Hygiene
Critters of Yarla influence often wear very little clothing despite the cold environment. They tend to accessorize a lot, though, especially with jewelry. City-dwelling Yarla critters usually wear shoes, while those living outside of cities often do not.

Bathhouses are very popular with Yarla critters; besides those in parts of the city of Destora, very few homes include a bathtub.

Yarla critters are very particular about how they smell, especially their breath, since they usually identify each other in part by breath. They prefer scentless toothpaste, as masking your breath is suspicious to Yarla critters.
## Food, Art, and Entertainment
Yarla culture has a heavy focus on food. Street food is especially popular. As with any other valley-based culture, [fernapple](Fernapple.md) is a popular addition; in Yarla, they may put fernapple slices on anything, even pizza!

Restaurants, bars, clubs, dancehouses, saunas, bathhouses, market halls, parks, and museums are popular hangout spots for Yarla critters. Dancing is a common pastime for friends.

No particular sport is more popular with Yarla critters, though cliques may form over specific sports.
## Cliques, Love, and Courtship
Blood bonds hold very little value in Yarla culture. Critters form their own families, called cliques, with their similarly-aged friends (although these friends can by chance be family members, such as siblings). A critter may be in multiple cliques at once, may leave or join cliques at any time, or may even form cliques of their own. When a critter lays an egg, one or more of the critter’s cliques will aid that critter in raising the hatchling until that hatchling is old enough to join or form a different clique.

Yarla critters are passionate and loving. Polyamory, same-sex couples, and exhibitionism are common and natural among Yarla critters, though critters usually prefer to interlope with other critters in their clique as long as they are not related and are of age. They will openly do this among the rest of the adults in their clique.

Critters of Yarla culture paint their eggs, much like [Ruti cultures](Ruti%20Culture.md). Usually, they throw party similar to a baby shower for the mother, where they all pitch in to paint the egg, as well as to incubate it when necessary. Egg shells are most often disposed of after the hatchling hatches.

Feeding and carrying for hatchlings is a job for the whole clique. The parents are no longer important; until the hatchling is ready to leave, everybody in the clique is practically a parent.

Hatchlings are usually considered adults after their 12th hatchday (or after about 18 Earth years), though today, some Yarla-heavy regions do not consider critters to be adults until their 13th hatchday (about 20 Earth years). Regardless, critters may leave their family to join or create a clique at as young as 3 calendar years of age (about 5 in Earth years).
