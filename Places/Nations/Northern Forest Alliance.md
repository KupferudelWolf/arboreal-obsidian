> Flag of the Northern Forest Alliance

The Northern Forest Alliance consists of ten states: [[Aurora]], [[East Mitiga]], [[Laelapsis]], [[Ptarma]], [[Tunora]], [[{SW_NFA}]], [[Dhy√•na]], [[{NE_NFA}]], [[Welpia]], and [[Westcradle]]. These states, many of which further divide themselves into subregions, voluntarily participate in this alliance by following its legislation, although they all remain mostly self-governing; in other words, the N.F.A. is a confederation. The alliance no longer recognizes a constitutional law, though each state (except Tunora) enforces its own constitution.

This nation is heavily influenced by [Ludi culture](Ludi%20Culture.md). It is the oldest nation in the [[Arboreal River Valley]].
