The **rook** (Yarla: **Å•okhi**) race is based on a single genetic trait that merges the hind legs and often the tail. These [critters](Critter. md) thus somewhat resemble earthly seals.

They are relatively rare in the [[Arboreal River Valley]]. [[Dhonharo]] has the highest population of rooks.
## Appearance
Rooks can look like anything as long as they have fully conjoined hinds. They usually visibly appear to lack tails (or sometimes even legs and feet).

Rooks cannot have antlers (due to genetics), though they may have one or two horns.
## Perception
The rook race is entirely based on one genetic trait. Thus, they are often defined by that genetic trait. Critters who meet rooks often assume (usually involuntarily) that they have a hard time or are in some way slighted by society. When rooks are rewarded or praised for an accomplishment, critters may assume that pity was involved: that a non-rook critter wouldn't be rewarded similarly. When critters talk about a rook, they may specify they're a rook, even if this critter wouldn't specify any other critter's race.

These perceptions are usually harmful to rooks. Ironically, the excessive concern over rooks tend to hurt them. Of course, rooks are, at least historically, disadvantaged; society for the longest time (and even presently in minor ways) was built by quadrupedal critters for quadrupedal critters. Critters having awareness of this history is certainly important, but rooks being defined solely by their genetic trait destroys their individualism and often leads to feelings of inadequacy and depression.

Most governing bodies in the [[Arboreal River Coalition]] require public entities to accommodate disabilities and hindrances, such as including ramps, slides, and elevators in skyscrapers. These are in part in place for rooks.
