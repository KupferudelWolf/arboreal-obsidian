A **skulker** ([[Yarla]]: **skelkher**) is a race of [critters](Critter.md) who somewhat resemble earthly foxes. They are the most commonly assigned race for critters native to the [[Arboreal River Valley]], partly because the traits associated with the race are quite broad. They are heavily associated with [[Yarla culture]] despite significant populations of other cultures.
## Appearance
Skulkers usually have striking contrast in their pelt, though they may be monochromatic. They must have either front talons or hind paws; otherwise, they are likely viewed as a [[router]] (with few exceptions).

If a critter has a massive tail (a tail that drags on the ground), then they are a skulker. The same usually applies to critters with multiple tails, especially those with more than two. Prominent whiskers are also common among skulkers, though this is mostly due to genetics. Critters without any of these features are often viewed as [bards](Bards.md).
## Perception
Skulkers and the [[Yarla culture]] are closely associated. Stereotypes of Yarla culture, such as exuberance and extraversion, are thus placed on skulkers as well. Critters in [[Arbor]] are especially guilty of this, both inside and outside of skulker populations.

Yarla culture and skulkers are both so prominent that Yarla skulkers tend to live in their own communities within cities, such as [[Skulker Village]] in [[Doveport]]. Skulkers in cities with such communities are pressured to participate in them, even if the individual is not of Yarla culture.

Beauty standards tend to be higher for skulkers than other races. This is due in part to Yarla fashion and in part to skulker celebrities like [[Talia]].
