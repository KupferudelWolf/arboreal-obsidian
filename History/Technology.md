The technology of the region is roughly on-par with most of the rest of the world, though this has only been the case in recent history. Meta-wise, the technology of Arboreal is based on Earthâ€™s technology between the 1920s and the 1950s. Advancements significant to the culture and life of Arboreal critters include the dirigible, the printing press, the steam and diesel engines, electricity, the radio and telephone, the car, and the phonograph. Siarki has begun development on early electromechanical computers.
## Agriculture
Farmers rely heavily on [sequencing](Entrogenesis.md) to improve crops.
## Automobiles
Private vehicles are adapted to the environment; they have skis in place of either front or back wheels. This design is not unique to the river valley; critters living in all colder regions of the world use vehicles of this form.

Roads are usually gravely. This reduces how slippery they are when icy. Road gravel in the [[Arboreal River Valley]] is tumbled before use so that the gravel is less bothersome to walk on without shoes.
