Although closely related, the Ruti culture in the [[Northern Forest Alliance]] is distinct from the [Ruti culture](Ruti%20Culture.md) in [[Siarki]], [[Dhonharo]], and [[Arbor]]. The Northern Ruti culture, often nicknamed the Ludi culture, is old and traditionalistic, dating back to the founding of the Northern Forest Alliance. Both cultures are tied to the [[Rudi]] language, however. Most Ludi critters are spiritual, with a large portion following [[Aetherianism]] and older related religions. Atheism and spiritual apathy are often shunned in Ludi culture.

Like with [Ridhil culture](Ridhil%20Culture.md), Ludi culture is in fact a very broad category of cultures, as different regions in N.F.A. practice different traditions, as do the small pockets of this culture outside of the nation. Below is a more broad, general sense of these cultures.
## Fashion
Ludi fashion consists of loose, soft, warm, practical clothing that covers most of their body. Hats never cover the ears, as the Ruti language relies on the ears; usually, critters forgo all head coverings. Shoes are also uncommon. They often emphasize their tails with tassel-like accessories.
## Food, Art, and Entertainment
Ludi food heavily focuses on baked goods and meats. Bread-bowl stews, baked sandwich rolls, and dumplings are popular Ludi delicacies throughout the river valley. Stews and soups are especially varied regionally. Some Ludi cultures produce traditional alcoholic beverages that incorporate hallucinogenic flower petals; this drink is intended to be consumed for spiritual reasons, not recreationally.

Pottery, sculpture, architecture, and literature in northern Ruti culture dates back to its origins. The culture values preservation and history too, so many of even the oldest Ludi monuments, stories, and artwork still exist.

Camping, plays, and storytelling are popular pastimes for Ludi critters.
## Community, Marriage, and Family
Critters in regions of heavy Ludi influence tend to form tightly-knit communities consisting of the families of a neighborhood. These communities help each other, especially with familial matters and issues. Major family events, like births and deaths, usually impact the entire community. Some communities are headed by a priest (separately from their government) who acts as a final say on community issues, while others are led by more prominent, meritorious, large, or affluent families.

Almost all Ludi cultures practice monogamy (although polyamory is rarely looked down upon). Critters of two separate communities will begin dating for an extended period of time. When the pair is set on marrying, one critter, usually the less feminine critter of the pair, will leave their community to join their fianc√©'s.
Both communities are typically invited to the wedding. The former community of the critter that left wear ashen grey clothes, while the community of the pair wear natural plant colors: purples, reds, yellows, and whites.

While intercourse outside of marriage is tolerable, egg-laying is not. This is because eggs are important to a community; if the loving pair are still in separate communities when they lay an egg, then they may feud over which one takes care of their egg, even if the couple themselves agreed on one community.

Egg-painting is a traditional practice present in all Ludi subcultures. The community will converge with all of their eggs and hold a sovereign celebration, usually with gifts. Critters with eggs cannot bring their own paints; other critters of the community provide the paints. The parents paint the eggs themselves, adorning the shell in traditional geometric patterns and earthy colors. Even in modern day, critters believe as a spiritual belief or as mere superstition that hatchlings whose eggs were left unpainted become evil or sick.

When a critter hatches, the parents usually save the painted egg-shells as a keepsake. After 6-8 calendar years, the parents tend to pass down some kind of heirloom to their child. Critters are considered adults after 11-14 calendar years (about 16-21 Earth years).
