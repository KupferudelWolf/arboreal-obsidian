**Aetherianism** is a polytheism revolving around twelve gods. Each god holds a specific domain and is responsible for everything related to their domain. Different sects of the religion interpret the range of these domains slightly differently, but for the most part, the domains themselves stay consistent.

Each of the twelve months on the Arboreal calendar are named after the twelve gods, though in all sects of Aetherianism, each god is celebrated from about halfway through their month until halfway through the next. Of the twelve gods, Helŕes and Skiln-Kha are the most venerated and have the most holidays in their yearly celebrations.
## Helŕes
Helŕes is the god of day, night, and sky, as well as life and death. He appears as a dark blue or black sleuth with the night sky's constellations on his pelt.

In Aetherianism, stars are viewed as souls; it is believed that all critters have a star inside them. When one passes away, flying scavenging animals carry this soul to Helŕes. He then guides this soul down the aurora, letting the recently deceased critter meet their ancestors’ stars. He then gives the critter their final resting place: as a star in the night sky. And the greater a life that critter led, and the more love they spread, the brighter their star shines.

Critters hatched during Helŕes’s celebration are believed to grow up to be mature and wise.
## Skiln-Kha
Skiln-Kha is the goddess of trade and food, as well as typically money and affluence. In many sects, she may also be considered the goddess of love or fertility despite Leŕindes covering this domain. She is portrayed as a light or glowing skulker with three or more tails.
She is known to be exuberant, indulgent, and chaotic. The expression “You’re challenging Skiln-Kha \[to a duel]!” describes a critter who is acting like Skiln-Kha, as if to imply they are trying to "one-up" Skin-Kha herself. Despite this, Skiln-Kha’s celebrations are the largest, as she is meant to embody indulgence.

Critters hatched during Skiln-Kha’s celebration are believed to grow up to be wealthy and popular.
## Leŕindes 
Leŕindes is the god of art, beauty, shelter, and fertility. He is portrayed as an enfaeld skulker with an incredibly colorful plumage of feathers. He is believed to have created colors himself.

Aetherian chapels, especially ones built to honor Leŕindes, are generally beautiful and intricate. Critters of both [Yarla](Yarla%20Culture.md) and [Ludi](Ludi%20Culture.md) cultures traditionally painted eggs in intricate geometric patterns to venerate this god; this practice continues to this day.

Critters hatched during Leŕindes’s month of celebration are believed to grow up to be creative and appreciative of the world.
## Ritsao
Ritsao ([[Yarla]] "Rit-tsayo" /ɻɪʈˈʈʂæjɤ/; [[Rudi]] "Litsao" /lɪʈˈʂʌɤ/) is the goddess of knowledge, wisdom, and dreams. She appears as a deep-blue-eyed white router with black speckles or short stripes, usually with a few on her forehead in a radial pattern.

She is believed to appear in dreams to give critters prophecies or wisdom. Those who claim to witness her describe a sort of aura or glow around her. Many emphasize that they are unable to part their eyes from her, and that her almost hypnotic voice lingers in their head.
Critters hatched during Ritsao’s month of celebration are believed to grow up to be clever and intuitive.
## Khine
Khina is the god of campfire, community, story, music, and dance. Their gender is often ambiguous; some sects may specify a gender, but most simply do not care. Khine is believed to have invented fire solely to inspire critters to gather together and tell stories.

Critters hatched during Khine’s month of celebration are believed to grow up to be amiable and energetic.
## Mazhe
Mazhe is the goddess of snow, health, mischief, and youthfulness. Mazhe is also associated with immunity and, in more modern times, vaccination; her mischievous antics are thought to prepare hatchlings better for life.
