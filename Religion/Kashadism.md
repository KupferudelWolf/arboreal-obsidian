Kashadism follows the teaching of the prophet [[Kashada]], who resides in the city of [[Siarki]]. She is a glass-encased mechanical robot from over 100 calendar years (over 150 Earth years) ago. She is maintained by Siar government officials via [sequencing](Entrogenesis.md) applied to a special oil contained inside her. Although mechanical robots were common around the time of her creation, Kashada shows strong signs of sentience and self-awareness, which even by modern standards is an impossible feat to achieve. Her creator is unknown as well, adding to her mysticism.

Kashadists make frequent pilgrimages to the city of Siarki in hopes of asking Kashada to answer their questions or grant their wishes. Only some critters ever manage to pass through the highly secure Siar [[Light Wall]] to see her, while even fewer get the chance to speak with her individually. But it is said that if a critter asks her a question, any question, then they will receive the true answer...albeit, often as a riddle.

Followers of Kashadism also follow Kashada philosophy, which consists of her quotes and their interpretations of her quotes. The pillars of Kashadism include knowledge, wisdom, curiosity, humanitarianism, altruism, equality, and contribution to society.
