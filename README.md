# Arboreal
## Synopsis
Arboreal is a science fantasy xenofiction about the [inhabitants](Critter) of the [[Arboreal River Valley]]: a northern region on the alien planet of [[Kidishi]].
## Setting
On a distant world of red trees and many moons thrives an alien species called critters. They resemble canines, yet they are very chimerical in appearance; horns, feathers, extra tails, and spines are the usual.
## Purpose
This world serves as the setting for my webcomic. I plan to run this webcomic to improve my art and discipline. Many aspects of the universe of Arboreal were chosen based on my personal preferences.
The webcomic will be written first in [[Yarla]], then translated into English. This will (intentionally) lead to a few strange translation errors.
## Story
One critter, a [[skulker]] (that is, a fox-like critter) named [[Aspen]], recently moved to [[Doveport]]: the largest city of the [[Arboreal River Valley]], known as the golden city of opportunity and the melting pot of the valley. Will she flourish in this new region? Who will she meet? Will she like Doveport's famous apple pizza?
In-universe, the artist of the webcomic is a [[router]] named [[Tselya]], who is writing this 65 calendar years (about an Earth century) after it takes place, as a historical fiction / slice-of-life comic. The unnamed translator acts as some kind of mysterious mediator between Kidishi and Earth; he is an avid fan of the comic, so he wishes to share it with Earth. Meta-wise, I receive them and pass them off as my own work; when I say, for example, I made these characters, within the context of the story, I am lying. ;3
