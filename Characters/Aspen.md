**Aspen** ([[Yarla]]: **Shenoŕ** /ʂɘˈɳɤɽ/; [[Zosyl]]: **Znōr** /ʒəˈnʊːɾ/) is an adult [Shuthl](Shuthl%20Culture.md) critter and the main character of the webcomic.

Aspen speaks [[Zosyl]] and [[Yarla]]. She can understand most [[Shuthl]].
## Appearance
She is a [[skulker]] with front talons and hind paws. Her fur is mostly white, with black, light cyan, and tan markings. Her eyes are heterochromic: one is blue and one is tan. Her pupils are narrow. She has large feathers attached to her scaled legs, and she has thick talons. She has one tail that reaches past her ankles.

After first moving to the [[Arboreal River Valley]], Aspen wears a lot of tight-fitting [Shuthl](Shuthl%20Culture.md)-style clothes; as the story progresses, she slowly adapts to [Yarla](Yarla%20Culture.md) fashion as she grows more comfortable with her body and with her new home.
## Personality
Aspen is kind, nervous, and somewhat socially awkward. She is reluctant to try new things, yet curious enough to want to try new things; this often leads to internal conflicts. She is fairly susceptible to peer pressure, though her conscious and fear keeps her from trying dangerous or destructive things.
## Backstory
Aspen was born somewhere in [[Riveria]] in a [[Zosyl]]-speaking family. She elected to study [[Yarla]] during her education and grew enamored with the history and culture present in the [[Arboreal River Valley]], though she wasn't sure if she could ever move there.

(What troubles in Riveria caused pushed her to make the move?)

Aspen arrived at [[Doveport]], the capital of [[Arbor]], via ship.
