The intelligent species of the world of [[Kidishi]] is the **critter** ([[Yarla]]: **choya**). A critter resembles several Earthly mammals, especially those from the northern regions of Earth. This includes wolves, foxes, bears, lynxes, deer, and caribou. Critters may also have attributes like those of earthly birds, especially corvids. Most often, however, a critter will resemble something in between: a wolf with antlers, a lynx with a beak, a moose with talons, and so on. They may even have bizarre features unrelated to their earthly analogues, growing quills, fins, scales, crystals, tendrils, extra appendages, multiple tails, unusual wings, and more! In short, critters are [especially genetically diverse](Genetic%20Traits.md).

Critters vary vastly in size as well, spanning from 0.1 meters to over 9 meters (or, 0.5 feet to over 30 feet)! They are almost always about 1 meter (about 3 feet) tall to the shoulder, however.

Despite this extreme diversity, the critter is a single species. Wolf-like critters and lynx-like critters are both just critters. The offspring of the two would not necessarily resemble a wolf-lynx hybrid; in fact, itâ€™s very possible they could resemble a deer instead!
## Life
Overall, critters live on average for 51 calendar years (about 78-79 Earth years). Through [sequencing](Entrogenesis.md), a critter may live up to 72 calendar years (almost 111 Earth years), though hypothetically, with perfect sequencing, they may live indefinitely.

Despite their genetic diversity, critters do not express much sexual dimorphism; male and female critters are hard to tell apart, even when viewing their...er, birth records. Different cultures handle this in very different ways.

About 3 Kidish days after conception, a critter may lay up to three eggs, with one single egg being extremely common. After 30 to 45 Kidish days (about 40 to 60 Earth days) of incubation, the newborn critter hatches from the egg.

New hatchlings feed on their parents' milk or special formulas.

Hatchlings grow into adults over 11-12 calendar years (about 17-19 Earth years), though some cultures and nations consider adulthood to be earlier or later. During this time, a hatchling may remain with their parents until adulthood or leave their family as young as 5 calendar years of age (about 7-8 Earth years), depending on the family and their culture.
# Races
Races are subjective; they are based on perception, culture, and personal biases. No nation officially recognizes any particular list of races; the distinction is just societal in nature. Races do not correspond with cultures, although different cultures may distinguish races differently.

Critters often do not fit under a single race; races are more of a spectrum.

Meta-wise, the races distinguished in the webcomic (and below) are tied to specific Earth analogues. The features listed below are stereotypical for each race and may not describe every critter associated with it. These races are [[bard]], [[dowter]], [[harrier]], [[rangler]], [[rook]], [[router]], [[skulker]], and [[sleuth]].
