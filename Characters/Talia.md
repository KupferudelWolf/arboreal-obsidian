**Talia** ([[Yarla]]: **Chalya**) is a large adult [Yarla](Yarla%20Culture%20.md) celebrity known for her modeling work for various cosmetic and jewelry brands. She also occasionally serves as an ambassador for [[Doveport]].

Talia only speaks [[Yarla]].
## Appearance
Talia is a very large [[skulker]] with four paws and a single massive tail. Her pelt is almost entirely white, with grey markings on her tail, nape, and paws. Her eyes are vividly pink. She has prominent whiskers of average length. She typically ties her nape with a bow and cuts the fur around her face short, letting her bangs grow and curl. She also occasionally has painted nails and extenuated whiskers.

By herself, she is generally unkempt, though others usually see her tidied up for ads or public appearances.
## Personality
Talia is extremely extroverted and robust. She often pushes herself onto others with little regard to personal space. Though she often comes across as rude and selfish, she almost always has good intentions. However, she loves control and resists authority when it challenges her beliefs or intentions.

She is somewhat known, especially outside of Yarla culture, for being promiscuous: a rumor with some truth behind it. Romantically, she leans toward feminine critters.

Talia shares with friends that she has always wanted to be in a band. She has no musical skills, however.
