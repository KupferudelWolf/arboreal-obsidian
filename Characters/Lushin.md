**Lushin** ([[Yarla]]: **Loshin**) is a [[Doveport]] courier. [[Aspen]] has a strong crush on her.
## Appearance
Lushin is a heavy-set medium-sized [[critter]] with light grey and white fur. Her eyes are pale blue. She has front paws and hind hooves; she is thus considered a [[router]] in the webcomic. She has a massive tail, though it naturally curls upward and spirals. She has tiny feathery wings that can move but absolutely cannot lift her. Her weight is a combination of thick bones, muscle, and fat.

Her courier uniform consists of bags that conceal her wings as well as a cowl. She occasionally wears a hat as well.

Lushin speaks [[Yarla]] and understands some [[Shuthl]].
## Backstory
Lushin was born in [[Tunora]], in the [[Northern Forest Alliance]]. She moved to [[Doveport]] because she was unhappy with Tunora life. She took various jobs there before finding that she fits great in the postal service thanks to her strength and endurance.
