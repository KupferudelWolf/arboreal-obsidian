## Writing
Yarla uses an abugida writing system unique to the language. Glyphs encode the onset in the upper half, the vowel in the lower half, and the coda within one or both of these halves. As an abugida, the writing system is mostly featural, though some onsets (especially n-, r-, and Å•-) will alter the lower half of most vowels in a semi-predictable way. Letters with onset y- are identical to those with onset w-, as are those with onset ch- and d-.

Yarla is traditionally written top-down, then left-to-right, with sentences usually breaking to the next line. Despite the top-down direction, Yarla characters are typically written taller than wide. In cases where Yarla is written left-to-right, the symbols do not rotate, though they may alter slightly in their strokes.

Yarla is usually written stoichedon; the glyphs are mostly aligned.
## Grammar
Yarla is a very head-final language with a strict subject-object-verb word order.

Sentences end with a particle that encodes mood and modality. In speech, this word often combines with the final word (the verb) as though it is a conjugation of the verb. A rising intonation in this particle (and often, the verb phrase as well) denotes a question.
